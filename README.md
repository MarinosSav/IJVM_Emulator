# IJVM Emulator
A programming project aimed at implementing an IJVM emulator using C. IJVM is an instruction set architecture created by Andrew Tanenbaum for his MIC-1 architecture. It is used to teach assembly basics and is mostly a subset of the JVM assembly language that is used in the Java platform.

This repository only includes my implementation without any testing files.
